### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Manifest V2 End of Life

**Impact**: HIGH

**What this means for users:**

- After deprecation, extension may be disabled
- Users will need to upgrade to V3 version when available

**What this means for developers:**
- Start planning Manifest V3 migration
- Service workers replace persistent background pages
- New permissions model required
- Some APIs will change

### ‚ö†Ô∏è document.execCommand() Deprecation

**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Timeline**: Deprecated but still supported  
**Action Required**: Migrate to Clipboard API

The `document.execCommand()` method used for clipboard access is deprecated.

**Migration path:**
```javascript
// Old (current)
document.execCommand('copy');
document.execCommand('paste');

// New (recommended)
navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
navigator.clipboard.readText();
```
